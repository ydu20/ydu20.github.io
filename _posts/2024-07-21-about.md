Hi! I'm a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying computer science and business. I'm passionate about creating software that solves real-world problems and provides tangible value to users. Specifically, I believe there is great potential for innovation at the intersection of technology and finance, and I hope to leverage the power of software to drive financial markets forward. In my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball, tennis, and Starcraft II.
